        <h3>History</h3>
        <img class="city" src="/final/images/brothers.jpg" alt="Old picture of the Wright brothers">
        <p>Dayton is the county seat of Montgomery County, Ohio.
         In 1796, Israel Ludlow surveyed and platted the town of 
         Dayton along the Great Miami River near the mouth of 
         the Mad River in what is now southwest Ohio. 
        </p>
        <p>
         It was located near the Symmes Purchase.
          The town was named for politician and Revolutionary 
          War veteran Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey. 
          By the end of that same year, more than forty log 
          cabins and frame houses had been built. Many of the 
          original settlers believed that they had legally 
          acquired their land, but disputes arose over
           landownership due to poor surveying. Many residents 
           ended up paying additional sums of money to become 
           the unchallenged owners of their property.
        </p>
        <p>
           In addition to these problems, Dayton was built on a 
           flood plain and the community was flooded a number of 
           times in its early years. </p>
        <p>In the twentieth century, Dayton continued to prosper. 
            The city became known as the home of Wilbur and Orville
            Wright, the brothers who made the first successful flight 
            in a powered aircraft.
